## Resampling

`x` is a random variable. We want to not only know what the `mean(x)` is but want to calculate the uncertainty of `mean(x)`.  Measuring the uncertainty requires repeated measurements of `mean(x)`.

- Calculate the mean of `x`.
- Calculte the `sd( mean(x) )` using the **using 10-fold resampling**.  Create your own folds, show your work.
- Calculte the `sd( mean(x) )` using the **using 10 bootstrap sample**.  Create your own folds, show your work. 

```{r}
set.seed(1) 
x <- runif(20,1,20)

#sd_cv # <- Your work here 
sd_cv <- function(x) {
  data_split <- split(x, 1:10) # creating 10 equal chunks of the vector
  means <- c() # creating holder variable for mean of all subsets
  for(i in 1:10){
   means <- append(means, mean(unlist(data_split[-i]))) # removing one chunk and converting list back to a vector to calculate mean
  }
  return(sd(means)) # returning SD on the mean values found above
}
#sd_cv(x)

#sd_boot # <- Your work here
sd_boot <- function(x) {
  data_split <- split(x, 1:10) #creating 10 equal chunks
  means <- c()
  for(i in 1:10){
    sampler <- sample(c(1:10), 10, replace=TRUE) #generating bootstrap chunks out of 10 chunks
    means <- append(means, mean(unlist(data_split[sampler]))) # calculating mean of all the generated bootstraped chunks
  }
  return(sd(means))
}

#sd_boot(x)

```


### Your answers here: 

- sd_cv   is: `r sd_cv(x)`
- sd_boot is: `r sd_boot(x)`
